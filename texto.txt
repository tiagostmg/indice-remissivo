Good programming is not just about writing code; it's about crafting
efficient algorithms and using proper data structures to solve problems.
Clean code is readable, maintainable, and follows best software development
practices. Computer science teaches us the importance of logic and abstraction.

Human-engineered software focuses on modularity, documentation, and testing
to ensure reliability. Debugging and optimization are key steps in improving
performance. Version control systems like Git help in collaboration among
developers, especially in Agile and Scrum methodologies.

Remember: programming is not just about making the computer understand your
code, but also about making it understandable for other humans. Always aim
for clarity and efficiency in your implementations.
